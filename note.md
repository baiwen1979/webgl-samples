## 1. Making Apache grant CORS permissionIf you're running a website with apache and you have the mod_rewrite plugin installed you can grant blanket CORS support by putting            Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"In the appropriate **.htaccess** file, and ask for CORS Permission in your JS code for resource object:        img.crossOrigin = "";    img.src = url;    or you can make a function that checks if the image we're trying to load is on the same origin and if so sets the crossOrigin attribute.        function requestCORSIfNotSameOrigin(img, url) {      if ((new URL(url)).origin !== window.location.origin) {        img.crossOrigin = "";      }    }
